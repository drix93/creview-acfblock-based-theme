# WP ACF block based theme for review.

## Overview
This repository includes files from a previous development to showcase my skills and thought process when using Advanced Custom Fields and its block feature within WordPress.

## Branches
There are two branches, master and trimmed.

* The master branch has the full child theme files.
* The trimmed branch has only those files which are seen as necessary for review.

## Parent Theme
The theme is based from a start up theme called [Understrap](https://understrap.com/) which combines the Underscores starter theme (by Automattic) and the mobile-first, responsive grid framework Bootstrap 4 (by Twitter) into a perfect open source foundation for any WordPress theme project.
* The parent theme can be found as a zip file if needed for any comparison.
